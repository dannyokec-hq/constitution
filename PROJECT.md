# Software Release Notes & Project Documentation Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to ensure consistent, clear, and informative release notes and project documentation for every iteration of our software. Adhering to these principles will help us maintain a high standard of communication and transparency with our users and fellow developers.

## Core Principles

1.  **User-Centric Approach:**
    * Focus on the impact of changes on the end-user.
    * Avoid technical jargon where possible. Explain complex concepts in simple terms.
    * Highlight the benefits and improvements for the user.

2.  **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    * Use clear, direct language.
    * Avoid ambiguity and vagueness.
    * Keep descriptions concise and to the point.

3.  **Transparency and Honesty:**
    * Document all significant changes, including bug fixes, feature additions, and removals.
    * Be transparent about any limitations or known issues.
    * Acknowledge any potential impact on users.

4.  **Structured Information:**
    * Use a consistent format for release notes and documentation.
    * Employ headings, lists, and code snippets to organize information effectively.
    * Use Markdown for readability.

5.  **Emphasis on Architectural Changes:**
    * When the system architecture is changed, highlight those changes.
    * Show before and after design changes.
    * Explain the benefits of the new systems.

## Markdown Structure Guidelines

### Release Notes (`README.md` or similar)

1.  **Introduction:**
    * Provide a brief overview of the release and its key highlights.
    * Clearly state the software version.

2.  **Key Changes and Features:**
    * Use headings to categorize changes (e.g., "New Features," "Bug Fixes," "Performance Improvements," "Security Updates").
    * For each change:
        * Provide a concise description.
        * Explain the impact on users.
        * If applicable, include code snippets or examples.
        * When applicable show the old design and the new design.
    * When JSON configurations are changed, show the before and after.

3.  **Migration Instructions (if applicable):**
    * Provide clear instructions for users upgrading from previous versions.
    * Highlight any potential compatibility issues.

4.  **Known Issues (if any):**
    * Document any known issues or limitations.
    * Provide workarounds or temporary solutions if available.

5.  **Future Plans (optional):**
    * Briefly outline any upcoming features or improvements.

6.  **Contribution Guidelines (for open-source projects):**
    * Provide instructions for contributing to the project.

### Code Snippets and Examples

* Use code blocks to display code snippets:

    ```markdown
    ```javascript
    // Example JavaScript code
    function exampleFunction() {
      // ...
    }
    ```

* Provide clear and concise explanations of code examples.
* When Json structures are changed, show the before and after of the changed structure.

### General Documentation Principles

* Maintain up-to-date documentation.
* Use version control to track changes to documentation.
* Encourage collaboration and feedback from other developers.
* When architecture changes occur, explain the benefits of the new architecture.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that our software releases are well-documented and provide a positive experience for our users and developers.
